# Node.js-and-MySQL

## Overview
Bamazon is a CLI App that is designed to mimic an Amazon-like storefront. Using MySQL and Javascript, the app takes in order from the customer and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

## Bamazon Customer
When one types in node bamazonCustomer.js into the command line, a table will pop up with 10 different items. The customer will then be asked what the id of the item they want to purchase is.
